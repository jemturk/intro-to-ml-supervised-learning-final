## Final Project - Heart Disease Prediction - Classification with Logistic Regression

Heart disease kills about a million people each year. 
Predicting if someone has heart disease early on can potentially save thousands of lives.

Thus, the goal of this project is to pick, build, and optimize a supervised learning model 
that can reliably predict if someone has heart disease.
